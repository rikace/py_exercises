# Python Workshop Part 1

#### Installation 

Recommended: install the Anaconda Distribution (link: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/). Please follow the Installation instructions for Python 3 and run the following examples in the Getting Started section (link: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/). 

Note: you are free to use Python 2 or 3. However, the examples (and solutions) will be done in Python 3. 

------

**Pedagogical Note:** Some of these questions will be harder than others. Try your best. The goal is to try and understand the problems, and learn how the basics of Python work. 

------

### Day 1 Basics

#### Exercise 1. 

Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).



#### Exercise 2. 

Write a function that returns the maximum of two numbers.



#### Exercise 3. 

Write a function that takes in a list of values and returns `True` if the first element and last element are the same, and `False` otherwise. 



#### Exercise 4.

Recall the quadratic formula: 
$$
ax^2+bx+c = 0, \implies x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
Write two functions `quad_pos` and `quad_neg` that return the positive and negative root of the quadratic. The arguments in the function will be `a`, `b`, and `c`. 

Note: you may need to import the `math` library to access the `sqrt` function to help here.

Hint: In Python, to raise a quantity by power `n`, we use double asteriks: `**`. (For example, to raise 2 to the power of 2: `2**2`.)



#### Exercise 5.

Write a function to return the factorial of a given number (named `myFactorial`). (Do not use a built in function to calculate.)

Hint: Recall that the `range()` function will automatically begin indexing at zero. 



#### Exercise 6. 

Write a function `pig_latin` to translate each word from a sentence into pig latin. In other words, when given a word, the function will take the first vowell and move the first part of the word before the vowel to the end, and adds "ay" to it. 

For example:
“hello”:  ellohay
 “computer”: omputercay 
 “string”: ingstray 

Example usage: 

```python
print(pig_latin("hello"))
> "ellohay" 

print(pig_latin("hello world"))
> "ellohay orldway" 
```

Hint: it may be helpful to break this up into several steps. For example,first, find a way to first translate an individual word. Then find a way to parse strings into individual words.



#### Exercise 7.

In economics and life, we often need to solve for $x$ when some arbitrary $f(x) = 0$. 

Write a function such that: 
Given some $f(x)$, an initial guess $x_0$, and a desired tolerance for error $\varepsilon$ (where $|f(x) - f(x_0)| \leq \varepsilon$), 
then the function will perform the following: 

1. Calculate the error of the guess $f(x_0)$. 
2. If the magnitude of the residual is less than or equal to the tolerance, then end. 
3. Calculate a correction to the guess and update the guess until it is within the tolerance. 

Newton's Method (link: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method)) is popular approach to perform such a calculation.

To help, I have provided some example functions and their first order derivative for you to use: 

```python 
import math 

def f1(x): 
    return((x*x)-1)
    
def df1(x): 
    return(2*x)
    
def f3(x): 
    return(math.sin(x))

def df3(x): 
    return(math.cos(x))

def f4(x): 
    return(math.log(x)-1)

def df4(x): 
    return(1/x) 
```



#### Exercise 8.

Write code that counts each term in a given document by looping through each word in the document. You may, for simplicity, assume that a document is represented in a string. Return the data in a dictionary form, where the keys are the words, and the values correspond to the counts. 

For example: 

```python
sample_string = "Hello my name is Melody."
term_count(sample_string)
> {Hello: 1, my: 1, name: 1, is: 1, Melody: 1}
```

Repeat the above, but this time use a dictionary based approach. 

Which method was faster? Why? 

Lastly, find the number of unique words in the string. 

(Continuing the above example...)

```python
unique_words(sample_string)
> 5
```

You may use the sample text here for the exercise:
