# Create a file called colors.txt and write each color
# in the color list to the file, one on each line.
# Don't forget the \n newline character

colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple", "pink"]




# Now, open colors.txt to read in values.  Loop through the values
# that result from readlines().  If the color has more than 4 letters in the name,
# print it.  Remember to strip whitespace (newline counts as a character!)
