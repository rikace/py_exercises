# Python Workshop
Python is among the most popular programming languages in the world. It’s leading the way in machine learning and data science due to its efficiency and speed. 

This workshop is designed for people with some experience programming, but no experience in Python.  We will introduce each topic enough so that you can quickly start using Python for your own problems knowing what tools are most appropriate. The workshop will be interactive with many examples (that the participants can play with during the session).

The Python Workshop introduces you to Python by clearly explaining the key concepts, applying the theory to solve engaging problems, and challenging you to complete practical exercises and activities. This hands-on book covers key topics, including data science, web development, and software development, empowering you with core skills that are in high-demand today. After a practical overview covering the basic syntax, you’ll explore various techniques to overcome common challenges that you might face in your daily work, such as sorting through a list of data using the optimal algorithm or adding visual aids to a dataset using Python. You’ll learn how to write effective programs, code for the web, analyze big data, predict outcomes using machine learning, and automate tasks to become a more effective developer.

## Preparation and requirements
